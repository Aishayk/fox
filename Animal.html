    <h4><li>The corn snake, also known as the red rat snake, is one of several species of rat snakes occurring in the United States. Rat snakes are large, powerful, nonvenomous snakes that feed on a variety of prey species, which they overpower by constriction.</li></h4>
    <h4><li>Young corn snakes are a favored food item of coral snakes and kingsnakes.</li></h4>
    <h4><li>The corn snake is mainly nocturnal and hides during the day under cover of loose tree bark, in animal burrows, or in old abandoned buildings.</li></h4>
    <h4><li> Predators of the corn snake include foxes, opossums, skunks, bobcats, weasels, and hawks.</li></h4>
    <h4><li> The corn snake can be distinguished from other rat snakes and from kingsnakes by the stripe extending from the back of its eye past the corner of its jaw, plus the large, bold black and white checkerboard pattern on its belly.</li></h4>
